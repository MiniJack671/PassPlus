# Pass+
Pass+ is a comprehensive, detailed and expandable pass plugin developer for Minecraft using the Spigot API. This plugin is inspired by the BattlePass apparent in the game Fortnite, some cross over features are things like: Tiers, Weekly Challenges and some sort of experience. The plugin aims to add an incentive for players to achieve some goals that might not be very desirable in Minecraft itself, this plugin adds another layer of customizable challenges to the game. It is primarily designed for the Factions and SkyBlock gamemodes, however, the plugins functionality and support is not limited to this mode. The plugin supports any gamemode / server type.

#### Why Is Pass+ Free?
Ultimately I have come to the conclusion that I want to pursue other things rather than just spigot development, therefore, it is just a hobby of mine. I don't think it is fair to make people pay for something that is a hobby project.
